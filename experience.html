                </div>
                I recognised that an appreciable and meaningful impact could be made in the school by connecting passionate and gifted students with those who struggle. MASH has grown to a size of twenty outstanding tutors who devote their personal time to helping other students. These students gain tutoring experience and earn their community service hours in a self-rewarding way. However, the greatest impact is on the students who struggle in the maths and sciences. Instead of repeatedly going home without understanding the material taught and neglecting their studies, students are now being tutored and set on a trajectory towards success

                </div>
                As a director, I made presentations and ran activities for the members with the goal of providing fun hands-on learning in science. Significantly, we ran the first ever region-wide Engineering and Science Olympics with eight participating secondary schools. We collected over $3000 in sponsorships and the event was a huge success. I was personally responsible for finding sponsors, designing and running an event, and briefing community volunteers. I ran a quadrathlon based on innovation where teams had to creatively solve scaled real world issues such as oil spills with limited materials.

                </div>
                 I saw Global Issues as a way for me to address the big problems and inequalities in this world, and find and create tangible ways to do something about them. Partnering with Key Club, Global Issues raised 700 pairs of used shoes. All of the shoes were donated to Soles4Souls where they went to those who have none and to people starting micro-enterprises. After a club executive saw the living conditions of the Fort Hope First Nations community first hand we centred an event our largest event called "Voices" around the voices of First Nations and the issues they face. I oversaw the production of the whole event from tickets to performers and tech support. The event raised over $3000 for the Fort Hope community.

               Car Club is a team of studenst who design, build and race Electrathon cars. Over the four years of my involvement, I have acted as a leader; taking charge of a small group of members to complete certain aspects of a car. I have created progressively more important and intricate pieces for the cars, and currently act as a driver and leader in the club to younger students, who shadow me to learn the design and building process.
